This Repo will be used for reproducing "Unsupervised Disentanglement of Pitch and Timbre for Isolated Music Instrument Sounds" published at ISMIR 2020.

The current status is only for a glance of the implementation, and not ready to serve the reproduction purpose.

Please stay tuned for future updates if you are interested.
